## what
Sol's RNG glitch hunting macro that rejoins your private server a lot of times until an interesting biome happens.<br>

Highly recommended to use AUTO ROLL, QUICK ROLL and VIP+.<br>

‚ö†Ô∏è If you plan to let this running all night with auto potion usage enabled, I **HIGHLY SUGGEST** you make some storage space, and set your cutscene to 2B++.<br>
üö´ This WONT use KINGS BLOOD nor OBLIVION POTIONS (for now).<br>

üö´ This DOES NOT and WILL NOT select auras for you if you roll something and you don't have storage, so keep that in mind!<br>
I won't be responsible for any mistakes/losses that happen in that regard. üòä<br>
*PS: I am not a developer. This means that I **CANNOT** restore your HP2s if anything happens. My bad gang.*

üî∞ **Heavily inspired by Maxstellar's Biome Macro, with adjustments of my liking.**<br>

*DISCLAIMER: I do not have knowledge of Maxstellar's Biome Macro code base, this is entirely coded by myself (and ChatGPT), and a lot of assumptions on how it should work, using his (Maxstellar's) application only as a model.
I didn't, and never intended to hurt Maxstellar's application popularity in no way, shape or form with this application, and if that happens, I kindly ask you to check about the features I implemented, 
I think some might be useful to have and I completely allow you to copy-paste my code! (Also, some features here are the sole reason why Im doing this project, LOL)*

## core features

The core concepts of this application are these three features listed below:
- "Server Rolling", that is, waiting for the first biome change on your private server, checking for useful biomes, and reseting your server so it goes back to Normal biome.
- **This is NOT implemented yet**: Individual pings for every biome, if you so desire. (Useful for glitch-hunting type servers to announce every type of biome possible with pings. 
- **This is NOT implemented yet**: Automatic heavenly potion usage. You will need to install Tesseract OCR for this to work / be trustful.

## faq

- **MOBILE VERSION?**<br>
No, there is not a mobile version. Im not coding that.

- **DOES IT RUN ON MY SYSTEM?**<br>
Im not sure if it runs in LINUX / MAC. This was only tested in Windows. You can try at your own risk, report your findings to me so I can make this thing better.

- **DO I HAVE TO INSTALL SOMETHING EXTRA?**<br>
You need Python installed on your system, and (NOT NECESSARY AT THE MOMENT >> ) Tessereact for text-image recognition.

- **IS THIS VIRUS???!?!?!?!**<br>
The .exe is not a Virus, it's the compiled code so you dont have to blow your head trying to understand how to run the code. If you understand python, you're more than welcome to read through the code and compile it yourself with pyinstaller.
